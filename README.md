ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jeremy Cowden.
- ðŸ‘½ I discovered my passion for front-end development in 2018 at Indiana University when I used simple HTML and CSS to draw a little green alien.
- ðŸ§  I'm currently building a website for my friend's recreational basketball league using the MERN stack.
- ðŸ‘€ I've recently been on the lookout for a role in front-end web development, ideally writing JavaScript or TypeScript. I'd especially love to work at a startup on a tight knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring or know of any opportunities, lets chat!
