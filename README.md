ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jeremy Cowden.
- ðŸ‘½ I discovered my passion for coding in 2018 at Indiana University when I used simple HTML and CSS to draw a little green alien.
- ðŸ§  I'm currently learning Next.js.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently seeking a front-end web development role, with a focus on JavaScript or TypeScript, but I'm always eager to learn and open to exploring new opportunities. Iâ€™d especially love to join a startup with a close-knit team where I can contribute and make an impact from day one. If youâ€™re hiring or know of any openings, Iâ€™d love to connect!
