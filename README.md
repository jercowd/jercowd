ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Jeremy Cowden.
- ðŸ‘½ I discovered my passion for coding in 2018 at Indiana University when I used simple HTML and CSS to draw a little green alien.
- ðŸ§  I'm exploring the intersection of AI and front-end development, where AI can automate tasks and enhance UI/UX, allowing us to streamline workflows and focus on solving complex problems while creating smarter, more dynamic user experiences. 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m currently seeking an AI focused front-end developer role, writing JavaScript and/or TypeScript, but I'm always eager to learn and open to exploring new opportunities. Iâ€™d especially love to join a startup with a close-knit team where I can contribute and make an impact from day one. If youâ€™re hiring or know of any openings, Iâ€™d love to connect!
